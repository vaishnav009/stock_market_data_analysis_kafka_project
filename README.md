# Stock Market Real-Time Data Analysis Using Apache Kafka

## Introduction 
In this project, I have executed an End-To-End real-time data pipeline using Apache Kafka which receives data from python real-time data simulator which stores it onto an AWS S3 bucket. This data is then loaded into an AWS Glue Data Catalog using Glue Crawler which can be used for querying and analysis.

We are going to use different technologies such as Python, AWS S3, Amazon EC2, Apache Kafka, AWS Glue Crawler, AWS Glue Data Catalog, Amazon Athena.
